GeoArt is a conceptual iOS app made for Steelhacks 2019.

The app uses the phone's location to create a unique piece of art. It does this by processing each digit of the phone's longitude and latitude as a different art parameters. 
For example, one digit may represent one shape's size, while another may represent the blue component of the piece's background. 
The nature of the algorithm ensures that each piece of art is unique to its longitude and latitude.

Here are some interesting examples of pieces of art created using this app:

The takeaway from this project is more than aesthetic. 
Sure, theoretically it would be very cool to have one's background set to the artwork corresponding to their current location. Their phone's background would change as the user went about their daily life, and it would be neat to begin to associate places with specific pieces of art.
However, some who have seen this project have also noted how it could be used for security purposes or proof of location purposes. 
For example, having screenshotted a specific piece of art could prove to somebody that the user was in a certain location.
